The epiLION project is aimed to provide a unified identifier for major lipids, especially oxidized lipids
in the epilipidome.

* Main Features

    + Optimized for manual interpretation and computer processing
    + Unified modification controlled vocabularies
    + Unified position specific annotations
    + Special optimization for prostane containing lipids
    + Suitable for head group modified phospholipids
    + Hierarchical abbreviation system  
    + Abbreviation to SMILES/ MOL / SDF conversion using python
    + Capable to parse fuzzy site unspecific annotations

## Instructions ##

### How to install epiLION from source code ###
* Download the source code as zip file for your system
    + Download epiLION source Code as .zip. Please notice the date and version of LipidHunter source code.
    + Professional users can use `git` to clone the whole repository, please make sure that you switched to the correct branch.
    + Only the released version is recommended for real data processing. Other development branches may lead to unknown issues and miss interpretation of the data.

* Rename the downloaded file to `epiLION.zip`
* Unzip `epiLION.zip` file to any folder.

* Python environment

    + epiLION is developed under python 3.6+.
    + The best way is to use virtual environment such as `conda`
    + Main dependencies are:
        - Data processing: `pandas`
        - SDF generation: `rdkit`
    + Test source code installation
        - Run `python epiLION.py -i Test/TestInput/test_names.txt -o Test/TestOutput/test_sdf.sdf` 
        - epiLION read list of epiLION abbreviations in the `test_names.txt` 
        and generate the structure in a combined sdf file.
        - unit test is provided in [`Test/test_epiLION.py`](Test/test_epiLION.py)
    
* SDF output

    + The sdf file is generated by using `rdkit` [https://www.rdkit.org](https://www.rdkit.org)
    + The sdf output can be used by:
        - Progenesis SDF studio, free for academic use:
        [http://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/sdf-studio/](http://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/sdf-studio/)
        - ChemAxon Instant Jchem, academic license available: 
        [https://chemaxon.com/products/instant-jchem](https://chemaxon.com/products/instant-jchem)
        
* Errors/bugs
  
    In case you experienced any problems with running LipidHunter
